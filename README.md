# Transverse-Array
Search insert position of the Nth/K item in an array, K is specified

# Workflow:
- Iterate over every element of the array arr[] and search for integer K.
- If any array element is found to be equal to K, then print index of K.
- Else if any array element is found to be greater than K, print that index as the insert position of K. 
- If no element is found to be exceeding K, K must be inserted after the last array element.
